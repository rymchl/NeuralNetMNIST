A simple neural network built to classify hand-writted digits from the MNIST dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
To load this dataset, I used the following: https://github.com/wichtounet/mnist
Other than that, everything is from scratch.

It is initally set up to load a presaved network I have trained to achieve an accuracy of around 85% on the testing dataset. 
To create a new network, or modify any actions, visit src/Main.cpp and read the comments.

To run:
  -Modify src/Main.cpp to your perferred configuration settings
  -Run 'make'
  -Run './main'
